# ios-test-52243

The following test is designed to measure how the applicant dissects and solves a series of challenges.

The challenge should take between 4-5 hours in total. If the challenge becomes more cumbersome than this, please pause and notify your interviewer.

Prerequisites/reading:

1. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/view_layout

Requirements:

1. Establish view(s) (use UIKit or SwiftUI): Search view, search results view, detail view

UI Flow:
